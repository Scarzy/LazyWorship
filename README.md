LazyWorship
===========

Worship presentation software with audio recognition.

LazyWorship is designed with the sole purpose of removing the computer operator during worship, allowing 1 more person to worship fully.
It works on a principle of fingerprinting audio samples and matching them against known samples in memory.
When LazyWorship is happy that it has selected the correct set of lines to be displayed it updates the display automatically.
